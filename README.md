# PCT Permit Checker Script
### By Leo Belyi

## What?

Yeah so this is a Selenium Python script that navigates to the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail) Permit website. It checks to see if there are any availabilities and then if there is it both prints out to the console and then I also hooked it up to my personal IFTTT Webhook to send me a notification on my phone.

## My Use Case

I'm basically running the `untilfail.sh` script on the python script (with a wait) so that I'm running the script every minute (or whatever length of time I choose) so that if there is a change in the website, then I'll be notified and I'll get sent a text. That way I can just try to secure the permit as soon as humanly possible. This is extra but I really really really want to be able to hike the Pacific Crest Trail and I want to have the best chance possible of securing a permit!!!
